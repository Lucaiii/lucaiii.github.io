yeah can we get like a mein kampf but for my first album i wanna put together

okay so if i somehow end up trying to save the rap game i'm definitely gonna call it "Burnt Pop-Tarts"

if i end up doing an acoustic album i have no idea what i'm gonna call it, probably something white-girl appealing like "Billy Pilgrim"
or something like "home" or something that sounds pandery (boy gotta love Bo Burnham)

also when are we getting the new gravy album
